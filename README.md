Problem Statement
=================

    Rahul has multiple credit cards of different banks and each of these banks generate card statements in different formats. In order to analyse his statements, Rahul needs our help to standardize them in single format. To help Rahul, we need to write a code that can normalize any statement in a standard format. Take reasonable assumptions and make the code as generic as possible. Look at all input files and standard output file before starting to code.

>Function signature to be implemented :-
> - StandardizeStatement( inputFile, outputFile)

Following key points need to be considered :-

 * A single Input file should be taken at a time as a parameter and output file should be generated for the same. `(Input/Output files should not be merged)`
 * While submitting the code, please attach all the four output files
 * Output file name should be as per input file name. `(Example of Input and output file name convention is given below for reference)`

> #### Example
> InputFile : HDFC-Input-Case1.csv
> OutputFile : HDFC-Output-Case1.csv

# formatingCSV
Basically simplification of format of csv files to standard csv_files
